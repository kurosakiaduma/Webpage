        <div style= text-align:"left"><img src="tric1.jpg" width="600" height="500" align="center" alt="a photo of Tric Gaming Cafe"></div>
        <p>There are a couple of reasons that I love Tric about
            <ul>
                <li>For starters isn't just the gaming bit, but the fact that
            everyone there is a pro.From FIFA to Injustice, no one is in that
            noob category when it comes to Tric</li>
                <li>The food and ambience there is just exhilarating!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Fogo Gaucho</h2>
